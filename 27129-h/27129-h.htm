<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="first"><span class="first-word">The</span> present Anthology is intended to serve as a companion volume to the
Poetical Miscellanies published in England at the close of the sixteenth
and the beginning of the seventeenth centuries. A few of the lyrics here
collected are, it is true, included in “England’s Helicon,” Davison’s
“Poetical Rhapsody,” and “The Ph&oelig;nix’ Nest”; and some are to be found
in the modern collections of Oliphant, Collier, Rimbault, Mr. W.J.
Linton, Canon Hannah, and Professor Arber. But many of the poems in the
present volume are, I have every reason to believe, unknown even to
those who have made a special study of Elizabethan poetry. I have gone
carefully through all the old song-books preserved in the library of the
British Museum, and I have given extracts from two books of which there
is no copy in our national library. A first attempt of this kind must
necessarily be imperfect. Were I to go over the ground again I should
enlarge the collection, and I should hope to gain tidings of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
song-books (mentioned by bibliographers) which I have hitherto been
unable to trace.</p>

<p>In Elizabeth’s days composers were not content to regard the words of a
song as a mere peg on which to hang the music, but sought the services
of true-born lyrists. It is not too much to say that, for delicate
perfection of form, some of the Elizabethan songs can compare with the
choicest epigrams in the Greek Anthology. At least one composer, Thomas
Campion, wrote both the words and the music of his songs; and there are
no sweeter lyrics in English poetry than are to be found in Campion’s
song-books. But it may be assumed that, as a rule, the composers are
responsible only for the music.</p>

<p>It was in the year of the Spanish Armada, 1588, that William Byrd
published “Psalms, Sonnets, and Songs of Sadness and Piety,” the first
Elizabethan song-book of importance. Few biographical particulars
concerning Byrd have come down. As he was senior chorister of St. Paul’s
in 1554, he is conjectured to have been born about 1538. From 1563 to
1569 he was organist of Lincoln Cathedral. He and Tallis were granted a
patent, which must have proved fairly lucrative, for the printing of
music and the vending of music-paper. In later life he appears to have
become a convert to Romanism. His last work was published in 1611, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
he died at a ripe old age on the 24th of July, 1623. The “Psalms,
Sonnets, and Songs” are dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton. In the
dedicatory epistle he terms the collection “this first printed work of
mine <i>in English</i>;” in 1575 he had published with Tallis “Cantiones
Sacræ.” From the title one would gather that Byrd’s first English
collection was mainly of a sacred character, but in an epistle to the
reader he hastens to set us right on that point:&mdash;“Benign reader, here
is offered unto thy courteous acceptance music of sundry sorts, and to
content divers humours. If thou be disposed to pray, here are psalms; if
to be merry, here are sonnets.” There is, indeed, fare for all comers;
and a reader has only himself to blame if he goes away dissatisfied. In
those days, as in these, it was not uncommon for a writer to attribute
all faults, whether of omission or commission, to the luckless printer.
Byrd, on the other hand, solemnly warns us that “in the expression of
these songs either by voices or instruments, if there be any jar or
dissonance,” we are not to blame the printer, who has been at the
greatest pains to secure accuracy. Then the composer makes a modest
appeal on behalf of himself, requesting those who find any fault in the
composition “either with courtesy to let the same be concealed,” or “in
friendly sort” point out the errors, which shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>corrected in a
future impression. This is the proper manner of dealing between
gentlemen. His next publication was “Songs of Sundry Natures,” 1589,
which was dedicated to Sir Henry Carey, who seems to have been as
staunch a patron of Byrd as his son, Sir George Carey, was of Dowland.
In 1611 appeared Byrd’s last work, “Psalms, Songs, and Sonnets.” The
composer must have taken to heart the precepts set down by Sir Edward
Dyer in “My mind to me a kingdom is,” (printed in “Psalms, Sonnets, and
Songs”) for his dedicatory epistle and his address to the reader show
him to have been a man who had laid up a large store of genial wisdom,
upon which he could draw freely in the closing days of an honourable
life. His earlier works had been well received, and in addressing “all
true lovers of music” he knew that he could rely upon their cordial
sympathy. “I am much encouraged,” he writes, “to commend to you these my
last labours, for mine <i>ultimum vale</i>;” and then follows a piece of
friendly counsel: “Only this I desire, that you will be as careful to
hear them well expressed, as I have been both in the composing and
correcting of them. Otherwise the best song that ever was made will seem
harsh and unpleasant; for that the well expressing of them either by
voices or instruments is the life of our labours, which is seldom or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
never well performed at the first singing or playing.”</p>

<p>No musician of the Elizabethan age was more famous than John Dowland,
whose “heavenly touch upon the lute” was commended in a well-known
sonnet (long attributed to Shakespeare) by Richard Barnfield. Dowland
was born at Westminster in 1562. At the age of twenty, or thereabouts,
he started on his travels; and, after rambling through “the chiefest
parts of France, a nation furnished with great variety of music,” he
bent his course “towards the famous province of Germany,” where he found
“both excellent masters and most honourable patrons of music.” In the
course of his travels he visited Venice, Padua, Genoa, Ferrara, and
Florence, gaining applause everywhere by his musical skill. On his
return to England he took his degree at Oxford, as Bachelor of Music, in
1588. In 1597 he published “The First Book of Songs or Airs of four
parts, with Tableture for the Lute.” Prefixed is a dedicatory epistle to
Sir George Carey (second Lord Hunsdon), in which the composer alludes
gracefully to the kindness he had received from Lady Elizabeth Carey,
the patroness of Spenser. A “Second Book of Songs or Airs” was published
in 1600, when the composer was at the Danish Court, serving as lutenist
to King Christian the Fourth. The work was dedicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>to the famous
Countess of Bedford, whom Ben Jonson immortalized in a noble sonnet.
From a curious address to the reader by George Eastland, the publisher,
it would appear that in spite of Dowland’s high reputation the sale of
his works was not very profitable. “If the consideration of mine own
estate,” writes Eastland, “or the true worth of money, had prevailed
with me above the desire of pleasing you and showing my love to my
friends, these second labours of Master Dowland&mdash;whose very name is a
large preface of commendation to the book&mdash;had for ever lain hid in
darkness, or at the least frozen in a cold and foreign country.” The
expenses of publication were heavy, but he consoled himself with the
thought that his high-spirited enterprise would be appreciated by a
select audience. In 1603 appeared “The Third and Last Book of Songs or
Airs;” and, in 1612, when he was acting as lutenist to Lord Walden,
Dowland issued his last work, “A Pilgrime’s Solace.” He is supposed to
have died about 1615, leaving a son, Robert Dowland, who gained some
fame as a composer. Modern critics have judged that Dowland’s music was
somewhat overrated by his contemporaries, and that he is wanting in
variety and originality. Whether these critics are right or wrong, it
would be difficult to overrate the poetry. In attempting to select
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
representative lyrics one is embarrassed by the wealth of material. The
rich clusters of golden verse hang so temptingly that it is difficult to
cease plucking when once we have begun.</p>

<p>In his charming collection of “Rare Poems” Mr. Linton quotes freely from
the song-books of Byrd and Dowland, but gives only one lyric of Dr.
Thomas Campion. As Mr. Linton is an excellent judge of poetry, I can
only suppose that he had no wide acquaintance with Campion’s writings,
when he put together his dainty Anthology. There is clear
evidence<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
that Campion wrote not only the music but the words for his songs&mdash;that
he was at once an eminent composer and a lyric poet of the first rank.
He published a volume of Latin verse, which displays ease and fluency
(though the prosody is occasionally erratic); as a masque-writer he was
inferior only to Ben Jonson; he was the author of treatises on the arts
of music and poetry; and he practised as a physician. It would be
interesting to ascertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
some facts about the life of this
highly-gifted man; but hitherto little information has been collected.
The Oxford historian, good old Anthony-à-Wood, went altogether wrong and
confused our Thomas Campion with another person of the same name who
took his degree in 1624&mdash;five years after the poet’s death. It is
probable that our Thomas Campion was the second son of Thomas Campion of
Witham, Essex, and that he was distantly related to Edmund Campion the
famous Jesuit. His first work was his “Epigrammatum Libri duo,”
published in 1595, and republished in 1619. The first edition is
exceedingly rare; there is no copy in the British Museum. Francis Meres,
in his very valuable (and very tedious) “Wit’s Treasury,” 1598, mentions
Campion among the “English men, being Latin poets,” who had “attained
good report and honorable advancement in the Latin empire.” In 1601
Campion and Philip Rosseter published jointly “A Book of Airs.” The
music was partly written by Campion and partly by Rosseter; but the
whole of the poetry may be safely assigned to Campion. From a dedicatory
epistle, by Rosseter, to Sir Thomas Monson, we learn that Campion’s
songs, “made at his vacant hours and privately imparted to his friends,”
had been passed from hand to hand and had suffered from the carelessness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
successive transcribers. Some impudent persons, we are told, had
“unrespectively challenged” (<i>i.e.</i> claimed) the credit both of the
music and the poetry. The address <i>To the Reader</i>, which follows the
dedicatory epistle, is unsigned, but appears to have been written by
Campion. “What epigrams are in poetry,” it begins, “the same are airs in
music: then in their chief perfection when they are short and well
seasoned. But to clog a light song with a long preludium is to corrupt
the nature of it. Many rests in music were invented either for necessity
of the fugue, or granted as an harmonical licence in songs of many
parts; but in airs I find no use they have, unless it be to make a
vulgar and trivial modulation seem to the ignorant strange, and to the
judicial tedious.” It is among the curiosities of literature that this
true poet, who had so exquisite a sense of form, and whose lyrics are
frequently triumphs of metrical skill, should have published a work
(entitled “Observations in the Art of English Poesy”) to prove that the
use of rhyme ought to be discontinued, and that English metres should be
fashioned after classical models. “Poesy,” he writes, “in all kind of
speaking is the chief beginner and maintainer of eloquence, not only
helping the ear with the acquaintance of sweet numbers, but also raising
the mind to a more high and lofty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
conceit. For this end have I studied
to induce a true form of versifying into our language; for the vulgar
and artificial custom of rhyming hath, I know, deterr’d many excellent
wits from the exercise of English poesy.” The work was published in
1602, the year after he had issued the first collection of his charming
lyrics. It was in answer to Campion that Samuel Daniel wrote his
“Defence of Rhyme” (1603), one of the ablest critical treatises in the
English language. Daniel was puzzled, as well he might be, that an
attack on rhyme should have been made by one “whose commendable rhymes,
albeit now himself an enemy to rhyme, have given heretofore to the world
the best notice of his worth.” It is pleasant to find Daniel testifying
to the fact that Campion was “a man of fair parts and good reputation.”
Ben Jonson, as we are informed by Drummond of Hawthornden, wrote “a
Discourse of Poesy both against Campion and Daniel;” but the discourse
was never published. In his “Observations” Campion gives us a few
specimen-poems written in the unrhymed metres that he proposed to
introduce. The following verses are the least objectionable that I can
find:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem smaller"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“Just beguiler,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kindest love yet only chastest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Royal in thy smooth denials,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Frowning or demurely smiling,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Still my pure delight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Let me view thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thoughts and with eyes affected,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if then the flames do murmur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quench them with thy virtue, charm them<br /></span>
<span class="i10">With thy stormy brows.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i10">Yet not still secure.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is artful ease and the touch of a poet’s hand in those verses; but
the Muses shield us from such innovations! Campion’s second collection,
“Two Books of Airs”, is undated; but, from an allusion to the death of
Prince Henry, we may conclude that it was published about the year 1613.
The first book consists of “Divine and Moral Songs” and the second of
“light conceits of lovers.” In dealing with sacred themes, particularly
when they venture on paraphrases of the Psalms, our poets seldom do
themselves justice; but I claim for Campion that he is neither stiff nor
awkward. Henry Vaughan is the one English poet whose devotional fervour
found the highest lyrical expression; and Campion’s impassioned poem
“Awake, awake, thou heavy sprite!” (p. 6) is not unworthy of the great
Silurist. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
the sacred verses are some lines (“Jack and Joan they
think no ill,” p. 61) in praise of a contented countryman and his good
wife. A sweeter example of an old pastoral lyric could nowhere be found,
not even in the pages of Nicholas Breton. The “Third and Fourth Books of
Airs” are also undated, but they were probably published in 1613. In
this collection, where all is good, my favourite is “Now winter nights
enlarge” (p. 90). Others may prefer the melodious serenade, worthy even
of Shelley, “Shall I come, sweet love, to thee” (p. 100). But there is
one poem of Campion (printed in the collection of 1601) which, for
strange richness of romantic beauty, could hardly be matched outside the
sonnets of Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">And there arrived, a new admirèd guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauteous spirits do engirt thee round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White Iope, blithe Helen, and the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear the stories of thy finish’d love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When thou hast told these honours done to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murder me!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mention of “White Iope” was suggested by a passage of Propertius:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem smaller"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
<span class="i0">“Sunt apud infernos tot millia formosarum;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pulchra sit, in superis, si licet, una locis.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vobiscum<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
est <i>Iope</i>, vobiscum candida Tyro,” &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Campion was steeped in classical feeling: his rendering of Catullus’
“Vivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus” (p. 80) is, so far as it goes,
delightful. It is time that Campion should again take his rightful place
among the lyric poets of England. In his own day his fame stood high.
Camden did not hesitate to couple his name with the names of Spenser and
Sidney; but modern critics have persistently neglected him. The present
anthology contains a large number of his best poems; and I venture to
hope that my attempt to recall attention to the claims of this true poet
will not be fruitless.</p>

<p>There is much excellent verse hidden away in the Song-books of Robert
Jones, a famous performer on the lute. Between 1601 and 1611 Jones
issued six musical works. Two of these&mdash;“The First Set of Madrigals,”
1607, and “The Muses’ Garden for Delight,” 1611,&mdash;I have unfortunately
not been able to see, as I have not yet succeeded in discovering their
present resting-place. Of “Ultimum Vale, or the Third Book of Airs”
[1608], only one copy is known. It formerly belonged to Rimbault, and is now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
preserved in the library of the Royal College of Music. The other
publications of Jones are of the highest rarity. By turns the songs are
grave and gay. On one page is the warning to Love&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem smaller"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Little boy, pretty knave, hence, I beseech you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if you hit me, knave, in faith I’ll breech you.” (p. 72.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On another we read “Love winged my hopes and taught me how to fly,” (p.
73); but the vain hopes, seeking to woo the sun’s fair light, were
scorched with fire and drown’d in woe,</p>

<div class="poem smaller"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And none but Love their woeful hap did rue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Love did know that their desires were true;<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Though Fate frownèd.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">And now drownèd<br /></span>
<span class="i12">They in sorrow dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the purest light of heaven for whose fair love they fell.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last line is superb.</p>

<p>I have drawn freely from the madrigals of Weelkes, Morley, Farmer,
Wilbye and others. Thomas Ford’s “Music of Sundry Kinds,” 1607, has
yielded some very choice verse; and Francis Pilkington’s collections
have not been consulted in vain. From John Attye’s “First Book of Airs,”
1622, I have selected one song, (p. 94), only one,&mdash;warm and tender and
delicious. Some pleasant verses have been drawn from the rare song-books
of William Corkine; and Thomas Vautor’s “Songs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> of Divers Airs and
Natures,” 1619, have supplied some quaint snatches, notably the address
to the owl, (p. 116) “Sweet Suffolk owl, so trimly dight.” I have
purposely refrained from giving many humorous ditties. Had I been
otherwise minded there was plenty of material to my hand in the
rollicking rounds and catches of Ravenscroft’s admirable collections.</p>

<p>As I have no technical knowledge of the subject, it would be impertinent
for me to attempt to estimate the merits of the music contained in these
old song-books; but I venture with all confidence to commend the poetry
to the reader’s attention. There is one poem which I have deliberately
kept back. It occurs in “The First Part of Airs, French, Polish, and
others together, some in tableture and some in prick-song,” 1605. The
composer was a certain Captain Tobias Hume, but who the author of the
poem was I know not. Here is the first stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem smaller"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Fain would I change that note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which fond love hath charm’d me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long long to sing by rote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fancying that that harm’d me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet when this thought doth come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Love is the perfect sum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all delight,’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have no other choice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either for pen or voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sing or write.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
The other stanza shall occupy the place of honour in the front of my
Anthology; for among all the Elizabethan song-books I have found no
lines of more faultless beauty, of happier cadence or sweeter
simplicity, no lines that more justly deserve to be treasured in the
memory while memory lasts.</p>

<p class="first"><span class="first-word">Thomas Weelkes</span> was organist of Winchester College in 1600, and of
Chichester Cathedral in 1608. His first collection, “Madrigals to three,
four, five, or six voices,” was published in 1597. Here first appeared
the verses (fraudulently ascribed, in “The Passionate Pilgrim,” 1599, to
Shakespeare), “My flocks feed not.” In 1598 Weelkes published “Ballets
and Madrigals to five voices,” which was followed in 1600 by “Madrigals
of five and six parts.” Prefixed to the last-named work is the following
dedicatory epistle:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0em;">“To the truly noble, virtuous, and honorable, my very good Lord Henry,
Lord Winsor, Baron of Bradenham.<br />

My Lord, in the College at Winchester, where I live, I have heard
learned men say that some philosophers have mistaken the soul of man for
an harmony: let the precedent of their error be a privilege for mine. I
see not, if souls do not partly consist of music, how it should come to
pass that so noble a spirit as your’s, so perfectly tuned to so
perpetual a <i>tenor</i> of excellence as it is, should descend to the notice
of a quality lying single in so low a personage as myself. But in music
the <i>base</i> part is no disgrace to the best ears’ attendancy. I confess
my conscience is untoucht with any other arts, and I hope my confession
is unsuspected; many of us musicians think it as much praise to be
somewhat more than musicians as it is for gold to be somewhat more than
gold, and if <i>Jack Cade</i> were alive, yet some of us might live, unless
we should think, as the artisans in the Universities of Poland and
Germany think, that the Latin tongue comes by reflection. I hope your
Lordship will pardon this presumption of mine; the rather, because I
know before Nobility I am to deal sincerely; and this small faculty of
mine, because it is alone in me, and without the assistance of other
more confident sciences, is the more to be favoured and the rather to be
received into your honour’s protection; so shall I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> observe you with as
humble and as true an heart, as he whose knowledge is as large as the
world’s creation, and as earnestly pray for you to the world’s Creator.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0em; text-align:right;">
<span style="padding-right:3em">Your Honor’s in all humble service,</span><br />
<span style="padding-right:2em"><span class="smcap">Thomas Weelkes</span>.”</span></p>

<p>In 1608 appeared Weelkes’ last work, “Airs or Fantastic Spirits for
three voices,” a collection of lively and humorous ditties. Oliphant
writes:&mdash;“For originality of ideas, and ingenuity of construction in
part writing, (I allude more especially to his ballets,) Weelkes in my
opinion leaves all other composers of his time far behind.” The verses
in Weelkes’ song-books are never heavy or laboured; they are always
bright, cheerful, and arch.</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_3">3</a>.</span> Robert Jones was a famous performer on the lute. He had a
share in the management of the theatre in the Whitefriars (Collier’s
“Annals of the Stage,” i. 395). His works are of the highest rarity. The
delightful lyrics in Jones’ song-books have escaped the notice of all
the editors of anthologies.</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_4">4</a>.</span> Thomas Morley, who was a pupil of William Byrd, was the author
of the first systematic treatise on music published in this country&mdash;“A
plain and easy Introduction to practical Music,” 1597, quaintly set down
in form of a dialogue. The verses in his collections are mere airy
trifles, and hardly bear to be separated from the music.</p>

<p>“About the maypole new,” &amp;c., is a translation of some Italian lines,
beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="margin-bottom:0em">
<span class="i0">“Al suon d’una sampogn’ e d’una citera,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Sopra l’herbette floride<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Dansava Tirsi con l’amata Cloride,” &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>In Morley’s “Canzonets to three Voices,” 1593, we have the following
pleasant description of the preparations for a country wedding:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="margin-bottom:0em">
<span class="i0">“Arise, get up, my dear, make haste, begone thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! where the bride, fair Daphne, tarries on thee.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Spice-cakes, sops-in-wine are a-dealing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run, then run apace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And get a bride-lace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gilt rosemary branch the while there yet is catching<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then hold fast for fear of old snatching.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! my dear, why weep ye?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O fear not that, dear love, the next day keep we.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">List, yon minstrels! hark how fine they firk it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how the maidens jerk it!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Kate and Will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tom and Gill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now a skip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a trip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finely fet aloft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There again as oft;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hey ho! blessed holiday!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All for Daphne’s wedding day!”<br /></span>
</div>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_9">9</a>.</span> John Wilbye is styled by Oliphant “the first of madrigal
writers.” He published his “First Set of English Madrigals” in 1598, and
his “Second Set” in 1609. The Second Set was dedicated to the
unfortunate Lady Arabella Stuart. The composer concludes his dedicatory
epistle with the prayer, “I beseech the Almighty to make you in all the
passages of your life truly happy, as you are in the world’s true
opinion, virtuous.” In the very year when the epistle was written the
gifted patroness of art and learning was accused before the Privy
Council and ordered to be kept in close confinement. She made her
escape, but after a few hours was captured at sea in her flight to
Dunkirk, brought back to London, and committed to the Tower, where she
died of a broken heart in 1615. It is pleasant to think that the
song-book dedicated to her honour may have cheered her in the long hours
of solitude. The collection consists chiefly of love-lyrics; but such
verses as “Happy, O happy he,” &amp;c. (p. 37) and “Draw on, sweet Night”
(p. 21), must have been carefully cherished by the poor captive.</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_9">9</a>.</span> “April is in my mistress’ face.”&mdash;Compare Robert Greene’s
verses in “Perimedes, the Blacksmith,” 1588:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">“Fair is my love, for April in her face,<br /></span>

<span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_11">11</a>.</span> “The Urchins’ Dance” is from the anonymous play “The Maid’s
Metamorphosis,” 1600. In the same play are the following dainty
verses;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div style="float:left;">“<i>1 Fairy.</i></div>
<span class="i12">I do come about the copse<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Leaping upon flowers’ tops;<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Then I get upon a fly,<br /></span>

<span class="i12">When I feel a girl a-sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Underneath her frock I peep,<br /></span>

<span class="i12">Then I bite her like a flea,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">And about I skip.”<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Thomas Ravenscroft, compiler of the “Brief Discourse,” won his spurs at
a very early age. He took his degree of Bachelor of Music before he had
reached his fifteenth year, as we learn from some commendatory verses
prefixed to the “Brief Discourse;”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“Non vidit tria lustra puer, quin arte probatus,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Vita laudatus, sumpsit in arte gradum.”<br /></span>
</div>

<p>He was twenty-two when he published the “Brief Discourse” in 1614: but
in 1611 be had published “Melismata, musical fancies fitting the court,
city, and country humours,” and he edited two collections that appeared
in 1609&mdash;“Pammelia” and “Deuteromelia.” “Pammelia” is the earliest
English printed collection of Catches, Rounds, and Canons; both words
and music were for the most part older than the date of publication.
“Deuteromelia” was intended as a continuation of “Pammelia.”</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_12">12</a>.</span> Robert Dowland, editor of “A Musical Banquet,” was a son of
John Dowland; he succeeded his father as one of the Court musicians in
1626, and was alive in 1641.</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_16">16</a>.</span> Thomas Ford, when he published his “Music of sundry kinds,”
1607, was a musician in the suite of Prince Henry.
At the accession of Charles I. he was appointed one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
his musicians, and he died in 1648&mdash;the year before his royal patron
was beheaded.</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_23">23</a>.</span> “Little lawn then serve[d] the Pawn.”&mdash;The Pawn was a
corridor, serving as a bazaar, in the Royal Exchange (Gresham’s).</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_24">24</a>.</span> “Farewell, false Love, the oracle of lies.”&mdash;“J. C.” in
“Alcilia,” 1595, writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Love is honey mixed with gall,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Robert Greene has a somewhat similar description of Love (“What thing is
Love? it is a power divine,” &amp;c.) in “Menaphon,” 1589.</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_28">28</a>.</span> “Fond wanton youths.”&mdash;This piece is also printed in “The
Golden Garland of Princely Delights,” 1620, where it is headed “Of the
Inconveniences by Marriage,” and is directed to be sung to the tune of
“When Troy town.”</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_29">29</a>, l. 22.</span> “Their <i>longings</i> must not be beguiled.”&mdash;The original
gives “Their <i>laughings</i>” (which is unintelligible).</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_31">31</a>.</span> It was at Wanstead House, a seat of the Earl of Leicester,
that Sidney wrote his masque the “Lady of the May” in honour of Queen
Elizabeth’s visit in 1578. “Was Raleigh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> retired there,” writes Mr. W.
J. Linton (<i>Rare Poems</i>, p. 257), “during some season of her
displeasure? There is a look of him about this song, not unlike the
lines to Cynthia; and what mistress but Majesty should appoint his place
of retirement?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Wanstead, my Mistress saith this is the doom.’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The two lines that close each stanza are from a song in Sidney’s
“Arcadia.”</p>

“Twelve Wonders of the World” (cf. pp. 44-5, 69); and, if I am not
mistaken, the reader will like to see the remaining eight. There is much
freshness and piquancy in these quaint old rhymes, which were written by
no less a poet than Sir John Davies.</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_66">66</a>.</span> John Danyel is supposed to have been a brother of Samuel
Daniel, the poet. He took his degree of Bachelor of Music in 1604. “At
the commencement of the reign of Charles the First he was one of the
Court Musicians, and his name occurs among the ‘Musicians for the Lutes
and Voices’ in a privy seal, dated December 20th, 1625, exempting the
musicians belonging to the Court from the payment of subsidies”
(Rimbault).</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_68">68</a>.</span> “Then all at once <i>for our town</i> cries.”&mdash;“I should imagine,”
says Oliphant, “that there was occasionally a sort of friendly
contention in the sports between neighbouring villages; which idea is
rather corroborated by a passage from an old play called the
‘Vow-breaker’ by Samson, 1636: ‘Let the major play the hobby-horse an’
he will; I hope <i>our Town lads</i> cannot want a hobby-horse.’” In an old
play. “The Country Girl,” (first printed in 1647), attributed to that
shadowy personage Antony Brewer, we have an allusion to this pleasant
form of rivalry:&mdash;</p>

in the midst of them dancing.”</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_73">73</a>.</span> “It was the purest light of heaven” &amp;c.&mdash;I am reminded of a

<p>“Sometimes would he go like a bellman in the night, and with many pretty

<span class="i0">“But my kisses bring again, bring again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Seals of love</i> but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(The first stanza is found among the poems of Sir Philip Sidney.)</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_80">80</a>.</span> “My prime of youth.”&mdash;This song is also set to music in
Richard Alison’s “Hour’s Recreation,” 1606, and Michael Este’s
“Madrigals of three, four, and five parts,” 1604. It is printed in
“Reliquiæ: Wottonianæ” as “By Chidick Tychborn, being young and then in
the tower, the night before his execution.” Chidiock Tychbourne of
Southampton was executed with Ballard and Babington in 1586.</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_80">80</a>.</span> “My sweetest Lesbia.”&mdash;The first stanza is an elegant
paraphrase from Catullus, though the last line fails to render the
rhythmical sweetness long-drawn-out of “Nox est perpetua una dormienda.”</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_81">81</a>.</span> “My Thoughts are winged with Hopes.”&mdash;This piece is also
found in “England’s Helicon.” A MS. copy, in a commonplace book found at
Hamburg, is signed “W. S.” I have frequently met with these initials in
volumes of MS. poetry of the early part of the seventeenth century. The
following pretty verses in Add. MS. 21, 433, fol. 158, are subscribed “W.
S.”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O when will Cupid show such art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strike two lovers with one dart?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m ice to him or he to me;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Two hearts alike there seldom be.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is not the slightest ground for identifying “W. S.” with
Shakespeare. Mr. Linton (“Rare Poems,” p. 255) conjectures that “My
Thoughts are winged with Hopes”&mdash;which has the heading “To Cynthia” in
“England’s Helicon”&mdash;may be by Raleigh.</p>

<p>“I woo with tears and <i>ne’er the near</i>.”&mdash;<i>Ne’er the near</i> (a proverbial
expression) = Never the nigher.</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_107">107</a>.</span> “When they came home Sis <i>floted</i> cream.”&mdash;I suppose the
meaning is that Sis skimmed the cream from the milk. Halliwell (<i>Arch.

north-country term for skimmed milk.</p>

really belong to Donne’s “Break of day;” it is not found in MS. copies

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_121">121</a>.</span> “The man of life upright.”&mdash;In some old MS. copies this poem
is ascribed to Francis Bacon: see Hannah’s “Poems of Raleigh and
Wotton,” p. 119. Canon Hannah makes no mention of Campion’s claim.
Campion distinctly tells us that he wrote both the verses and the music
of his songs: and I have no doubt that he was the author of the present
lyric, which has more merit than any of Bacon’s poems. In an epigram
printed in his “Observations in the Art of English Poetry,” 1602, there
is a striking image that reappears in the present poem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“A wise man wary lives yet most secure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sorrows move not him greatly, nor delights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fortune and death he scorning only makes<br /></span>

virtuous contention between W. Byrd and Ferrabosco who of the two should
best set these words; in which according to his (Peacham’s) opinion,

text; the second and third stanzas run thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Learn to speak first, then to woo, to wooing much pertaineth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He that hath not art to hide, soon falters when he feigneth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as one that wants his wits, he smiles when he complaineth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“If with wit we be deceived our faults may be excusèd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeming good with flattery graced is but of few refusèd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of all accursed are they that are by fools abusèd.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_131">131</a>.</span> “Thou art not fair for all thy red and white.”&mdash;These lines
are printed in Dr. Grosart’s edition of Donne’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> poems, vol. ii. p. 259.
They are ascribed to Donne in an early MS.; but I see no reason for
depriving Campion of them. (The first stanza is also set to music in
Thomas Vautor’s “Airs,” 1619.)</p>

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_132">132</a>.</span> “Though Amaryllis dance in green.”&mdash;Also printed in

<p><span class="gap"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_148">148</a>.</span> “We must not part as others do.”&mdash;These lines are very much
in Donne’s manner. The MS. from which they are taken (Egerton MS. 2013)
contains some undoubted poems of Donne.</p>

are assigned to Edward Earl of Oxford. Appended in the MS. are the
